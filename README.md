# AlcohoList2

-WIP-

This is an experiment to delve into writing open source code, following licensing standards, and generally writing Android code.

## Feature List

- DrawerLayout
- Switches
- FloatingActionButtons / "Speed Dial"
- Clipboard reading
- QR reading (via Varvet)
- NFC reading (not 100%)
- NFC writing (not 100%)
- NFC beaming

TODO:

- Implement the whole menu layout thing that is the core of the app
- Filter NFC properly. Don't launch app from NFC unless the mimetype says so.
- Read URLs properly to pull down data
- Add sharing options, such as...
- Create QR codes from app to launch app (like the NFC mimetypes) that can also be shared, downloaded, and printed

## Licenses

The QR code in this app comes from Varvet's BarcodeReaderSample and uses an MIT License.
